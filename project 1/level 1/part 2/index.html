<p><sub>I</sub>&nbsp;hear&nbsp;<sup>love</sup>
	<br><sub>I</sub>&nbsp;believe&nbsp;<sup>in</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>of</sub>&nbsp;struggling&nbsp;
	<br><sub>love</sub>&nbsp;Love&nbsp;<sup>is</sup>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<sub>pool</sub> blue-green algae
As desolate micro-burst of wind
Bleeding through my veins
Years stationed in the belief
I believe that all can hear
Even anticipate discrete, I met the other their own
Some can not grasp the moment
Prajna Paramita, soon as soon as
life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves
Also care about what has</p>
