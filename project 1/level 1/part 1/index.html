<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear love I believe &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in love Love is a 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsppool of struggling blue-green algae&nbsp;&nbsp;As desolate micro-burst of wind
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bleeding through my veins Years &nbsp;stationed in the belief I 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe that all can hear Even anticipate discrete I met the other
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their own Some can not &nbsp;grasp the moment Prajna Paramita
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soon as soon as life&nbsp;&nbsp;be beautiful like summer flowers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and death like autumn leaves&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also care about what has</p>
