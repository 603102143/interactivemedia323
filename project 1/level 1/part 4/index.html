<p>I hear love
<br><br>I believe in love
<br><br><br>Love is a pool of 
<br><br><br><br>struggling blue-green algae As desolate
<br><br><br><br><br>micro-burst of wind Bleeding through my
 <br><br><br><br><br><br>veins Years stationed in the belief I believe

 that all can hear Even anticipate discrete I met
 the other their own Some can not grasp the moment

Prajna Paramita soon as soon as life be beautiful like summer
 flowers and death like autumn leaves Also care about what has
