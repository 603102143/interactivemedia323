<p>I hear love
<br><br>I believe in love
<br><br><br>Love is a pool of 
<br><br><br><br>struggling blue-green algae As desolate
<br><br><br><br><br>micro-burst of wind Bleeding through my
<br><br><br><br><br><br>veins Years stationed in the belief I believe
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>that all can hear Even anticipate discrete I met
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>the other their own Some can not grasp the moment
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Prajna Paramita soon as soon as life be beautiful like summer
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>flowers and death like autumn leaves Also care about what has
